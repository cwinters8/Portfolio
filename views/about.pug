            | I have been working in the technology industry as a System and Database Administrator since 2011. Around 2014, I started writing some Bash scripts to perform repetitive tasks, and thus my passion for development was born. After being in a couple DevOps roles between 2015 and 2018, I started taking my interest in development seriously. Since then, I've spent all my free time learning Web Development and improving my skills. I'm currently enrolled in Team Treehouse's online Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program. I'm also scheduled to start an online Web Development Bachelor's program with Bellevue University starting in March 2019.
